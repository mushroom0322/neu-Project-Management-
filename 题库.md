35. The technique of fast tracking can result in lengthening the project schedule. (T)

36. Why is top management commitment crucial for project managers?

    >Project managers need adequate resources. The best way to kill a project is to withhold the required money, human resources, and visibility for the project. If project managers have top management commitment, they will also have adequate resources and not be distracted by events that do not affect their specific projects.
    >
    >Project managers often require approval for unique project needs in a timely manner. For example, on large information technology projects, top management must understand that unexpected problems may result from the nature of the products being produced and the specific skills of the people on the project team. For example, the team might need additional hardware and software halfway through the project for proper testing, or the project manager might need to offer special pay and benefits to attract and retain key project personnel. With top management commitment, project managers can meet these specific needs in a timely manner.
    >
    >Project managers must have cooperation from people in other parts of the organization. Since most information technology projects cut across functional areas, top management must help project managers deal with the political issues that often arise in these types of situations. If certain functional managers are not responding to project managers' requests for necessary information, top management must step in to encourage functional managers to cooperate.
    >
    >Project managers often need someone to mentor and coach them on leadership issues. Many information technology project managers come from technical positions and are inexperienced as managers. Senior managers should take the time to pass on advice on how to be good leaders. They should encourage new project managers to take classes to develop leadership skills and allocate the time and funds for them to do so.

|      | d.   | project procurement management    |

43. The scope of a project is clear and specific from the start. (F)

44. Every project should have a well-defined objective. (T)

45. What are milestones? Describe.

    > A **project milestone** is a way to observe, measure and monitor the progress and/or performance of a project. Milestones in general exist as intermediate stages that must be fulfilled before reaching a final goal or objective. In terms of their usefulness, milestones can be defined and provide a foundation from which to monitor progress. They can also serve as proof for explaining and reporting the status of a project. Key characteristics of milestones include their frequency and potential for providing opportunities for course corrections and learning experiences. Milestones can also be used to maintain accountability and motivate staff.
    >
    > Milestones are the most important and visible events in a project and normally have no duration. It often takes several activities and a lot of work to complete a milestone, but the milestone itself is like a marker to help in identifying necessary activities.

46. Describe the process of scope validation.

    > The process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. Includes reviewing deliverables with the customer or sponsor to ensure that they are completed to satisfaction, and obtaining formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer/sponsor.

16. Describe critical path analysis. How is the critical path calculated?

    > Critical path analysis is a network diagramming technique used to predict total project duration. This important tool can help combat project schedule overruns. A critical path for a project is the series of activities that determine the earliest time by which the project can be completed. It is the longest path through the network diagram and has the least amount of slack or float. To find the critical path for a project, one must first develop a good network diagram, which, in turn, requires a good activity list based on the work breakdown structure. Once a network diagram is created, one must also estimate the duration of each activity to determine the critical path. Calculating the critical path involves adding the durations for all activities on each path through the network diagram. The longest path is the critical path.

17. A drawback of the project management software is that it does not have the capacity to calculate the critical path(s) for a project. (F)

18. Which of the following is true of the project life cycle?

|      |      |                                                              |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | a.   | More resources are usually needed during the initial phases of a project than during the middle or final phases. |
| *    | b.   | In the early phases of a project life cycle, resource needs are usually lowest. |
|      | c.   | It is much more expensive to make major changes to a project during the earlier phases than the latter phases. |
|      | d.   | In the later phases of the project life cycle, the level of uncertainty is usually the highest. |

19. List and describe the five process management groups.

    > Initiating processes include defining and authorizing a project or project phase. Initiating processes take place during each phase of a project. Therefore, you cannot equate process groups with project phases. Recall that there can be different project phases, but all projects will include all five process groups. For example, project managers and teams should reexamine the business need for the project during every phase of the project life cycle to determine if the project is worth continuing. Initiating processes are also required to end a project. Someone must initiate activities to ensure that the project team completes all the work, documents lessons learned, assigns project resources, and that the customer accepts the work.
    >
    > Planning processes include devising and maintaining a workable scheme to ensure that the project addresses the organization's needs. There are several plans for projects, such as the scope management plan, schedule management plan, cost management plan, procurement management plan, and so on, defining each knowledge area as it relates to the project at that point in time. For example, a project team must develop a plan to define the work that needs to be done for the project, to schedule activities related to that work, to estimate costs for performing the work, to decide what resources to procure to accomplish the work, and so on. To account for changing conditions on the project and in the organization, project teams often revise plans during each phase of the project life cycle.
    >
    > Executing processes include coordinating people and other resources to carry out the various plans and produce the products, services, or results of the project or phase. Examples of executing processes include acquiring and developing the project team, performing quality assurance, distributing information, managing stakeholder expectations, and conducting procurements.
    >
    > Monitoring and controlling processes include regularly measuring and monitoring progress to ensure that the project team meets the project objectives. The project manager and staff monitor and measure progress against the plans and take corrective action when necessary. A common monitoring and controlling process is reporting performance, where project stakeholders can identify any necessary changes that may be required to keep the project on track.
    >
    > Closing processes include formalizing acceptance of the project or project phase and ending it efficiently. Administrative activities are often involved in this process group, such as archiving project files, closing out contracts, documenting lessons learned, and receiving formal acceptance of the delivered work as part of the phase or project.

20. The best way to sustain a project is to withhold(决绝给予) the required money, human resources, and visibility for the project. (F)

21. IT project managers must be able to present and discuss project information both in financial and technical terms. (T)

22. Which is a similarity between the crashing and fast tracking?

23. What are tangible and intangible costs? Distinguish between direct and indirect costs and give examples of each.

    > Tangible and intangible costs and benefits are categories for determining how well an organization can define the estimated costs and benefits for a project. Tangible costs or benefits are those costs or benefits that an organization can easily measure in dollars. Conversely, intangible costs or benefits are costs or benefits that are difficult to measure in monetary terms. Intangible benefits for projects often include items like goodwill, prestige, and general statements of improved productivity that an organization cannot easily translate into dollar amounts. Because intangible costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, they are often harder to justify. 
    >
    > Direct costs are costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project. One can attribute direct costs directly to a certain project. Project managers should focus on direct costs, since they can control them. For example, direct costs include the salaries of people working full time on the project and the cost of hardware and software purchased specifically for the project. Indirect costs are costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project. For example, the cost of electricity, paper towels, and so on in a large building housing a thousand employees who work on many projects would be indirect costs. Indirect costs are allocated to projects, and project managers have very little control over them.

43. Describe three tools used in developing a good cost estimate.

    > Several tools and techniques can be used to create a cost estimate. Three of such tools are as follows: 
    >
    > (1) Analogous estimates: They use the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for estimating the cost of the current project. This technique requires a good deal of expert judgment and is generally less costly than other techniques, but it is also less accurate. Analogous estimates are most reliable when the previous projects are similar in fact, not just in appearance. In addition, the groups preparing cost estimates must have the needed expertise to determine whether certain parts of the project will be more or less expensive than analogous projects. 
    >
    > (2) Bottom-up estimates: They involve estimating the costs of individual work items or activities and summing them to get a project total. This approach is sometimes referred to as activity-based costing. The size of the individual work items and the experience of the estimators drive the accuracy of the estimates. Using smaller work items increases the accuracy of the cost estimate because the people assigned to do the work develop the cost estimate instead of someone unfamiliar with the work. The drawback with bottom-up estimates is that they are usually time-intensive and therefore expensive to develop. (3) Parametric estimating: They use project characteristics (parameters) in a mathematical model to estimate project costs. Parametric models are most reliable when the historical information used to create the model is accurate, the parameters are readily quantifiable, and the model is flexible in terms of the project's size.
