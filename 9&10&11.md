Chapter 9:Project Resource Management

Making the most effective use of the human and physical resources involved with a project

Planning resource management
Estimating activity resources
Acquiring resources
Developing the project team
Managing the project team
Controlling resources



Douglas McGregor popularized the human relations approach to management in the 1960s
Theory X: assumes workers dislike and avoid work, so managers must use coercion, threats and various control schemes to get workers to meet objectives
Theory Y: assumes individuals consider work as natural as play or rest and enjoy the satisfaction of esteem and self-actualization needs
Theory Z:  introduced in 1981 by William Ouchi and is based on the Japanese approach to motivating workers, emphasizing trust, quality, collective decision making, and cultural values



Thamhain and Wilemon: ways to have influence on projects
Authority: legitimate hierarchical right to issue orders
Assignment: ability to influence a worker's later work assignments
Budget: ability to authorize others' use of discretionary funds
Promotion: ability to improve a worker's position
Money: ability to increase a worker's pay and benefits
Penalty: ability to cause punishment
Work challenge: ability to assign work that capitalizes on a worker's enjoyment of doing a particular task
Expertise: perceived special knowledge that others deem important
Friendship: ability to establish friendly personal relationships between the project manager and others



Ways to influence
Project managers who use work challenges and expertise to influence people projects are more likely to succeed
Projects are more likely to fail when project managers rely too heavily on authority, money, or penalty



Power is the potential ability to influence behavior to get people to do things they would not otherwise do
Power is much stronger than influence, because it is often used to force people to change their behavior
Types of power 
Coercive
Legitimate
Expert
Reward
Referent



Resource leveling is a technique for resolving resource conflicts by delaying tasks
Main purpose is to create a smoother distribution of resource usage
Benefits of resource leveling
When resources are used on a more constant basis, they require less management
May enable project managers to use a just-in-time inventory type of policy for using subcontractors or other expensive resources
Results in fewer problems for project personnel and accounting department
Often improves morale



The main goal of team development is to help people work together more effectively to improve project performance 
It takes teamwork to successfully complete most projects
Tuckman model describes five stages of team development
Forming
Storming
Norming
Performing
Adjourning



Software can help in producing a simple responsibility assignment matrix or resource histograms 
Software includes several features related to human resource management 
Assigning and tracking resources
Leveling resources
Resource usage reports
Overallocated resource reports
To-do lists



###### Chapter 10:Project Communications Management

Main processes in project communications management
Planning communications management
Managing communications
Monitoring communications



As the number of people involved increases, the complexity of communications increases  
More communications channels or pathways through which people can communicate
Number of communications channels = n(n-1)/2 



Failure to communicate is often the greatest threat to the success of any project, especially IT projects
Communication is the oil that keeps a project running smoothly
Project communications management involves planning communications management, managing communications, and controlling communications




Project managers can spend as much as 90 percent of their time on Failure to communicate is often the greatest threat to the success of any project, especially IT projects
Communication is the oil that keeps a project running smoothly
Project communications management involves planning communications management, managing communications, and controlling communications



Project managers can spend as much as 90 percent of their time on A communications management plan of some type should be created for all projects to help ensure good communications
Contents will vary based on the needs of the project



###### Chapter 11:Project Risk Management

Project risk management is the art and science of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk throughout the life of a project and in the best interests of meeting project objectives



Suggestions for identifying risks: tools and techniques 
Brainstorming
The Delphi Technique
Interviewing
SWOT analysis



Often follows qualitative risk analysis, but both can be done together
Large, complex projects involving leading edge technologies often require extensive quantitative risk analysis
Main techniques 
Decision tree analysis
Simulation
Sensitivity analysis



Risk management is an investment
Costs are associated with identifying risks, analyzing those risks, and establishing plans to address them

Implementing risk responses involves putting the appropriate risk response plans into action
Monitoring risks involves monitoring implementation of risk response plans, tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating effectiveness of risk management throughout the entire project
