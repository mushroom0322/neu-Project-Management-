###### Chapter 5:Project Scope Management

Main processes
Planning scope management: determining how the projectâ€™s scope and requirements will be managed
Collecting requirements: defining and documenting the features and functions of the products produced during the project as well as the processes used for creating them
Defining scope: reviewing the project charter, requirements documents, and organizational process assets to create a scope statement
Creating the WBS: subdividing the major project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components
Validating scope: formalizing acceptance of the project deliverables
Controlling scope: controlling changes to project scope throughout the life of the project



Scope management plan contents
Prepare a detailed project scope statement
Create a WBS
Maintain and approve the WBS
Obtain formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables
Control requests for changes to the project scope



Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project
Foundation document that provides the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and changes



###### Chapter 6:Project Schedule Management

Project time management processes
Planning schedule management
Defining activities
Sequencing activities
Estimating activity resources
Estimating activity durations
Developing the schedule
Controlling the schedule



Elements of a schedule management plan 
Project schedule model development
Scheduling methodology
Level of accuracy and units of measure
Control thresholds
Rules of performance measurement
Reporting formats
Process descriptions



Important tools and techniques 
Gantt charts
Critical path analysis
Critical chain scheduling
PERT analysis



Main techniques for shortening schedules
Shortening durations of critical activities/tasks by adding more resources or changing their scope
Crashing activities by obtaining the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost
Fast tracking activities by doing them in parallel or overlapping them



It is important to update the schedule with actual data
Note actual activity durations as they are completed 
Revise estimates for activities in progress
Monitor changes to make informed decisions



Other knowledge points are reviewed in the calculation question record



###### Chapter 7:Project Cost Management

Project cost management includes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget
Planning cost management: determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost
Estimating costs: developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to complete a project
Determining the budget: allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance
Controlling costs: controlling changes to the project budget



Project cost management is a traditionally weak area of IT projects
Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management to be effective in managing project costs


Main processes 

Plan cost management
Estimate costs
Determine the budget
Control costs

Several software products can assist with project cost management



Other knowledge points are reviewed in the calculation question record



###### Chapter 8:Project Quality Management

Project quality management ensures the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken

Project quality management processes
Planning quality management: identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to satisfy them; a metric is a standard of measurement
Managing quality: translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities
Controlling quality: monitoring specific project results to ensure they comply with the relevant quality standards



Basic tools of quality that help in performing quality control
Cause-and-effect diagrams
Control chart
Checksheet
Scatter diagram
Histogram
Pareto chart
Flowcharts/run charts



Many IT professionals think of testing as a stage that comes near the end of IT product development
Testing needs to be done during almost every phase of the systems development life cycle, not just before the organization ships or hands over a product to the customer
